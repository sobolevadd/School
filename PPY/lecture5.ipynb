    "Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "... is a programming paradigm that focuses on the creation of objects that contain both data and behavior. Python supports OOP and provides robust support for OOP concepts. Here are the main OOP concepts in Python and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes define the properties and methods that all objects of that class will have. You can use classes and objects in Python to organize your code and create reusable code modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a way to create a new class based on an existing class. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the existing class and can add new functionality or modify existing functionality. You can use inheritance in Python to reuse code and create new classes quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or method call. In Python, you can achieve polymorphism through method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a way to hide the implementation details of a class from the outside world. In Python, you can use access modifiers like private and protected to control the access to the properties and methods of a class."
