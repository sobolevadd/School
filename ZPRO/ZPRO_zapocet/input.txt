It has meant working around the clock for BBC Persian journalists.
But reporting on events in Iran is not just a logistical challenge, 
it also has serious personal ramifications. 
The harassment it triggers from the Iranian government 
creates consequences for the lives of the journalists.
In October 2022, 
the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement naming 
BBC Persian in a list of individuals and organisations 
sanctioned for what it called their deliberate actions in support of terrorism, 
and inciting violence and hate speech and human rights abuses.
BBC Persian journalists have received online death threats and threats of horrific violence, 
and thousands of orchestrated abusive comments.
